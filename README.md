Textbook, the social texting platform

Textbook is a barebones skeleton of a social text platform in which users can perform a number of actions such as establishing their username, posting threads, commenting on threads, deleting threads, and viewing all threads. This is a work in progress Java project in which I plan to add new features every now and then to sharpen my Java skills.
